title: "Two Routes of Being Great"

I am very lucky of having a great job where my boss and the company in general are being the most supportive as they can. One of these efforts is the weekly one-on-one meeting with my direct supervisor. I noticed this meeting became my recharging station to boot my energy for weekly work as well as a upgrade my perspective on the seemingly boring part of the job.

Very different than my supervisor, I lack his passion of being a great engineer or technical lead. I just don't feel like taking a pride in that identity. For me, being machine learing engineer is just a craftman which is one of many common identity I can think of. Yeah, I enjoy challenging myself (when it's in certain scope), but so far, I don't see why one craft can be more exciting than another craft, then I can't foster my loyalty to becoming a great machine learning or software engineer.

The seem question can go to marriage, politics, religion, college major. Has there ever been one choice being more superior than the other? If you ask studying computer science over biology, for me, the answer is yes. But why is that my answer? There are people who built a business empire who studied biology and followed that path.

I think one of my counless mistakes is that I have been seeking an identity, instead of creating one. They two do sound pretty much same except the part of the ownership of this identity. If one day, I become convinced that identiy X is not exciting anymore, then of course I would change my mind in second. However, I can choose another quite uncertain and either more liberizing or more frustrating route: developing my own identity. It should not have a predefined definition, maybe 10% enginner, 20% campaigner, 5% speculator, 30% alligator, 45% lost soul. Whatever it is, it's about the excitement, not about the profession.

That's why I keep changing mind. If I am loyal to my excitement, then natually I cannot be loyal to my profession, because it comes secondary.
