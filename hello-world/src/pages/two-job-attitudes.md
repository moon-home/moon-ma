I am very lucky of having a great job where my boss and the company in general are being the most supportive as they can. One of these efforts is the weekly one-on-one meeting with my direct supervisor. I noticed that this meeting became my recharging station for my weekly work as well as an upgrade of my perspective on the seemingly boring part of the job.

For example, I wasn't very motivated to learn about business specific data.

Very different than my supervisor, I lack his passion of being a great engineer or technical lead. I just don't feel like taking a pride in that identity. For me, being machine learing engineer is just a craftman which is one of many common identity I can think of. Yeah, I enjoy challenging myself (when it's in certain scope), but so far, I don't see why one craft can be more exciting than another craft, then I can't foster my loyalty to becoming a great machine learning or software engineer.

The same question can go to marriage, politics, religion, college major. Has there ever been one choice being more superior than the other? If you ask studying computer science over biology, for me, the answer is yes. But why is that my answer? There are people who built a business empire who studied biology and followed that path.

I think one of my counless mistakes is that I have been seeking an identity, instead of creating one. They two do sound pretty much same except the part of the ownership of this identity. If one day, I become convinced that identiy X is not exciting anymore, then of course I would change my mind in second. However, I can choose another quite uncertain and either more liberizing or more frustrating route: developing my own identity. It should not have a predefined definition, maybe 10% enginner, 20% campaigner, 5% speculator, 30% alligator, 45% lost soul. Whatever it is, it's about the excitement, not about the profession.

Coming back to the topic of job attitude, I don't think either way can be right or wrong, the real problem is always one level higher than the current problem. In this case, rather than asking which attitude you want to take (Option 1. get by and enjoy yourself. Option 2. push yourself and contribute to the company), you should (1) establish what you want to become and reverse back the path (2) find the third option.

Also the first solution would last longer, the second solution is so much easier to find. (The trick is to first bring up my mood then think, not have the hope for the other way around.) So my answer is (1) push myself and enjoy myself. Push myself to learn as much as I can in terms of coding, project management, communication, work habit, etc, and enjoy myself on the elements that I do still like such as haveing a relaxing and supportive environment and the autonomous part of my position.

I will start talking about the first solution in another time soon.
